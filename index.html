                MJ’s gravity-defying performances on the court (see “the shot”)
                no doubt help the Air Jordan franchise’s popularity, but the
                kicks were also starting to become a pop culture icon away from
                the hardwood. Jordan again paired with director Spike Lee, and a
                scuffed AJ IV was featured in a scene that took on race, class
                and gentrification in his film Do the Right Thing. The sneaker
                was Jordan’s first global release and gave the wearer the
                ability to lace up in 18 different patterns to but their own
                spin on the shoe.

                For the 30th shoe in the franchise, designer Tinker Hatfield
                drew inspiration from Jordan’s “otherworldly talents” to create
                the forward looking AJ XXX. Hatfield started to sketch and drew
                inspiration from a famous photo of MJ preparing to dunk with the
                basketball cocked behind his head. XXX, the roman numeral for
                30, appears several times in the design, including a graphic
                that wraps around the heel and on the bottom of the sole. The
                shoes feature maps on each tongue: Africa on the right shoe, and
                North America on the left.

                The Jordan 6 Rings is a commemorative hybrid sneaker combining
                elements from the six signature Air Jordan shoes that MJ wore en
                route to winning his six NBA championships – hence the epic
                model name. Historically, the 6 Rings has always been a divisive
                model among Jordan collectors due to its hodgepodge design, and
                occasionally garish colourways. However, many will agree that a
                classic palette like the ‘Hare’ can make things much easier to
                digest.

                The Air Jordan VIII debuted the same year that Jordan and the
                Chicago Bulls cemented themselves as a dynasty by capturing
                their third consecutive NBA championship. MJ also three-peated
                as Finals MVP and led the league in scoring for the seventh year
                in a row. Designer Tinker Hatfield ran wild on these kicks: the
                AJ VIII is the only model in the franchise to feature crossover
                straps atop the laces, the tongue sports a fuzzy chenille
                Jumpman graphic, and the Black/Bright Concord — Aqua Tone
                colorway made it a “distinctly ’90s sneaker.”

                After a season in which Jordan repeated as NBA champion, Finals
                MVP and regular season MVP, he rocked the Air Jordan VII on the
                international stage as part of the infamous “Dream Team” that
                took home gold in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The original
                sneakers featured MJ’s number 23, but a special Olympic colorway
                was released with his Team USA number 9. All the designs for the
                AJ VII were inspired by African Tribal prints. The AJ VII also
                marked a visible split from Nike branding and a blossoming
                pairing with Bugs Bunny. The commercial featured Bugs as “Hare
                Jordan” alongside the original “Air Jordan.”

                MJ was officially back with a vengeance: “En route to one of his
                most impressive years to date, Jordan clinched MVP, All-Star MVP
                and Finals MVP before securing his fourth championship ring.”
                For the AJ XI, designer Tinker Hatfield wanted something that
                embodied performance and aerodynamics. He drew his inspiration
                from a shiny convertible body and created the base of the shoe
                out of patent leather. Jordan reunited with old pal Bugs Bunny
                for the Space Jam movie, and the AJ XI were featured in a scene
                that pans upward from MJ’s sneakers to his face.

                The AJ XXXVI was designed around the concept of “light” — as
                sight, sensation, and symbolism. The design team set out to
                craft the lightest Jordan shoe yet. The shoe features a
                breathable and flexible jacquard leno-weave material plus extra
                Zoom Air cushioning. The Zoom bags are enclosed in an infinity
                ribbon design in the midsole symbolizing MJ’s “infinite
                influence across the sport and beyond.” The lace cover and heel
                embellishments are reminiscent of the AJ VI, the shoe in which
                MJ won his first title. The AJ XXXVI is built with a new crop of
                explosive Jordan Brand athletes in mind, including Satou
                Sabally, Jayson Tatum, and Kia Nurse.
